# ML Model

This directory contains the machine learning components for the AI-based Internship Recommendation Engine.

## Purpose
The ML model provides:
- Intelligent matching between candidate profiles and internship opportunities
- Content-based filtering using academic background and interests
- Collaborative filtering based on similar user preferences
- Location-based recommendations
- Continuous learning and model improvement

## Technology Stack
- Python with ML libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Natural Language Processing for text analysis
- Recommendation algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based)
- Model serialization and deployment
